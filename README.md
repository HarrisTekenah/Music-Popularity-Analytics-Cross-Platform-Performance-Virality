# 🎵 Multi-Platform Music Popularity Analysis

**Can virality guarantee listenership?**
This project is about the cross-platform dynamics of music track performance — comparing trends across **Spotify**, **TikTok**, **YouTube**, and others — to understand how popularity manifests differently across ecosystems.

## Project Overview

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigates:

* Whether viral TikTok hits translate to Spotify streams
* The relationship between playlist exposure and streaming numbers
* How YouTube views align (or don’t) with Spotify popularity
* The effect of **seasonal trends** on listenership
* Which artists consistently dominate across platforms — and which don’t

Real-world case studies like *Blinding Lights* by The Weeknd provide concrete examples of universal success, while other tracks reveal more fragmented patterns of platform-specific appeal.

## What i found

* **Virality ≠ Listenership**: TikTok likes and views show little correlation with Spotify streams.
* **Spotify Playlists Matter**: Playlist reach moderately correlates with stream count.
* **Platform Silos**: YouTube views don’t strongly align with Spotify popularity metrics.
* **Timing is Strategic**: Seasonal effects (e.g. year-end spikes) influence performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* Data wrangling, correlation matrices, bar charts, line plots, and seasonal decomposition

## Next Steps

* Build predictive models to forecast cross-platform success
* Cluster tracks based on platform performance patterns
* Integrate more real-time or region-specific data sources

## Motivation

This was a "vibe coding" session turned serious — an intuitive exploration of modern music trends using data. With virality driving the music industry today, this project aims to untangle the myth that one viral moment equals lasting success.
